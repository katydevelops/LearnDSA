Binary Search

Given an array of integers 'nums' which is sorted in ascending order and an integer 'target', write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

Input: nums = [-1, 0, 3, 5, 9, 12], target = 9
Output: 4
Explanation: 9 exists in nums and it's index 4

Start by examining the left pointer, midway point and right pointer. Our midway point will be 3. Is the target greater than or less than 3? It's greater than so we update our section of the array to look at the [5, 9, 12] portion and then start over. The midpoint is 9, which is our target, so we return the index of 9 which is 4 (from the original nums array).
